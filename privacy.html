  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cheekd Inc. ("Cheekd," "us" or "we") will collect and use its users information (“you”) when using the Cheekd application or service. By using our website, application or technology (our “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We highly recommend that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, you may contact us at the email address listed at the end of this policy.

    

    <h2>1. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</h2>
    

    <h2>a. Personal Information</h2>
    <p>In order for you to take advantage of opportunities provided through the app (for example, to register with us), we may collect personal information that can identify you ("PII") such as your full name and email address and other information that does not identify you. You may also have the option to upload your photograph.
    

    <h2>b. Proximity services technology</h2>
    <p>One of the technologies that Cheekd uses is called “Proximity” Services. The platforms and applications that use this technology are called “Proximity Platform.” Proximity Platform works by collecting the “information” that smart phones and other wireless devices transmit publicly for the very purpose of being discovered and making electronic connections with other devices – sort of like nametags at a conference.</p>

    <p>Cheekd is using proximity services that have created an evolution of location-based services. It is also important for you to know that we do not and cannot collect any “content” from any of your calls, emails, posts, tweets, etc., or other communications that go over your smartphone. We just collect the device addresses, and then it is up to you to link whatever other information or services that you choose to associate with a tagged device. This association feature can incorporate many types of your favorite social media, including your Twitter user name, Facebook name or location data like a Foursquare venue and more—as long as you had previously chosen to make those profiles or feeds unrestricted and public in your privacy settings.</p>

    <p>For our service to work, you need to enable your phone hardware settings for Bluetooth, WiFi, Near Field Communications (NFC if you have it) and GPS and in some instances you need to have a cellular or WiFi data connection to the Internet. Cheekd Proximity Platform and other similar applications and its technology license partners work because smartphones and other wireless devices have radio transmitters that let them connect to networks or other devices through the air.  Each of these radios has a number or name that is unique to that piece of equipment here we call it “Equipment Identifiers ”. This “Equipment Identifiers” that is broadcast into the air so that other devices can “discover” and connect with them.</p>

    <p>Our technologies let your smartphone discover these radio addresses and “tag” them so you can tell when you and your smartphone get close to other Cheekd user device. Cheekd collects and uses these unique equipment identifiers so that users like you know when they are the same physical space with other devices whose radio addresses they have tagged. We call this a “proximity” application because users can get notified when a device they’ve tagged comes into or goes out of range, or make certain things happen automatically when you and your smartphone get close to another device you’ve tagged.</p>

    <p>“Proximity” for our purposes means how close are you to the device you’ve tagged:

    <ul>
      <li>Range for Bluetooth transmitters is around 30 feet.</li>
      <li>Range for NFC transmitters is under an inch.</li>
      <li>Range for GPS is around 30 feet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While smartphones and other gadgets publicly broadcast a number of different unique “Equipment Identifiers,” Cheekd only collects and uses the publicly discoverable names and numbers for WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Near-Field-Communications (NFC) devices and some cellular tower location data depending on the technology or carrier. When you sign up to use our service, Cheekd allows you to discover and tag your devices by their unique WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS or NFC addresses. These are based on users’ devices that broadcast publicly.</p>

    

    <h2>c. Non-Personal Information Automatically Collected  </h2>
    
    <p>Non-PII is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. These information are collected automatically when you use our service. We collect non-PII including IP addresses, identification numbers associated with your device (such as UDID), mobile carrier, device type and manufacturer, phone number, and, if you have enabled features and functions of the Services that use your device’s location, your geographical location data (including GPS). We also collect information about your usage of, and activity on, our Services. </p>

    

    <h2>d. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information. Cookies are small bits of information that our web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to, among other things, facilitate our login processes; allow you to personalize and store your settings; collect usage information; determine our total audience size and traffic; and help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to users.</p>

    <p>We also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we may include web beacons and cookies in our e-mail messages in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.</p>
    
    <h2>e. Information that you provide. </h2>

    <p> In order to register as a user with Cheekd, you will be asked to sign in using your Facebook login. If you do so, you authorize us to access certain Facebook account information, such as your public Facebook profile (consistent with your privacy settings in Facebook), your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, relationship interests, current city, photos, personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your Facebook friends who might be common Facebook friends with other Cheekd users. You will also be asked to allow Cheekd to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You may also provide us photos, a personal description and information about your gender and preferences for recommendations, such age range and gender. If you chat with other Cheekd users, you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication. </p>
    

    <h2>2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
    

    <h2>a. Generally.</h2>
    
    <p>We may use our PII in the following ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide the requested Services: to administer and maintain your Cheekd account and generally provide the functions and features that are part of the Services (including providing communications as described below).

This includes using your information as described in this Policy and providing the functions and features of the Services to you;</li>

We will use your Contact Information when we communicate with you. Where it is relevant to the issues we are contacting you about we may also use the other categories of information described in Section 1 above;</li>
      <li>Protect the Services and Cheekd’s property: to detect and prevent abusive, fraudulent, malicious or potentially illegal activities, and to protect the rights, safety or property of Cheekd or our users. We will predominantly use information about how you use the Services and information provided by others (such as reports from other users relating to your conduct on the Services), although we may use other categories of information described in Section 1 where they are relevant for this purpose;</li>
      <li>Geographical or GPS location-based services: to provide features of the Services that may be relevant to you and your geographical location or GPS information, such as Services provided through our mobile apps that may allow users to see more information about each other, for example, common restaurants or points of interest visited or seen; you should always check the location-based settings on both your device and on the Services to manage such services;</li>
      <li>Because non-PII does not identify you, we reserve the right to use non-PII for any purpose and share non-PII with third parties without restriction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>b. Sharing your Information</h2>
    <p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or if we inform you otherwise at the time of data collection, we will not share your PII with third parties.</p>
    <p>Other Cheekd Users: When you register as a user of Cheekd, your Cheekd profile will be viewable by other users of the Service. Other users will be able to view information you have provided to us directly or through Facebook, such as your Facebook photos, any additional photos you upload, your first name, your age, approximate location, your personal description. If you press “Get Cheeky” and say “yes” to a person, you will be able to chat with that person if they do the same, e.g., when you have a “match.” If you chat with your match, of course your match will see the content of your chat.</p>
    <p>Affiliates: We may share your PII with affiliated companies and businesses.</p>
    <p>Service Providers: We may use other companies to perform services including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of our Site, sending e-mail, and fulfilling purchase requests. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your PII solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.</p>
    <p>Special Circumstances: We also may disclose your PII:</p>
    <p>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or other request from a law enforcement or government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.

    <p>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as the sale of all or a portion of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

    <h2>4. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
